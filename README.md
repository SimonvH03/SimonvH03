## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm working on the Codam curriculum.

I'm experimenting with different ways to organize projects; how to use Makefiles, custom libraries like <a href="https://github.com/SimonvH03/libft_utd.git">Libft</a>, and how to structure subdirectories.

I especially enjoyed the <a href="https://github.com/SimonvH03/fdf.git">FdF</a> project.

Starting with no experience I've found it works wonders to discuss ideas with others, however stupid or complicated they might seem.
