## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm working on the Codam curriculum since october 2023.

I just wrote a game in C in three weeks, check it out <a href="https://github.com/SimonvH03/Cub3d.git">here</a>

I really enjoyed the <a href="https://github.com/SimonvH03/fdf.git">FdF project</a>, it inspired me to write <a href="https://github.com/SimonvH03/Cub3d.git">Cub3d</a> in my free time.

Starting the curriculum with no prior experience I've found it works wonders to discuss ideas with others, however stupid or complicated they might seem.
