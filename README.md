## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm working on the Codam curriculum since october 2023.

I created two graphical projects I'm particularly pleased with as part of this course: <a href="https://github.com/SimonvH03/Cub3d.git">Cube3D</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SimonvH03/fdf.git">FdF</a>.

Starting the curriculum with no prior experience I've found it works wonders to discuss ideas with others, however stupid or complicated they might seem.
